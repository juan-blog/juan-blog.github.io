      <description>I recently wrote about how I migrated my organizational system to an analog system. I had been using the Bullet Journal for a few months, but I encountered a great difficulty: I was not using it. I never filled it out and two or three weeks went by without even opening it. I abandoned the bujo long ago, gave away the Moleskine I had bought and returned to a digital system, which makes a lot of sense now that I work in the city and through virtual classes via Zoom.</description>
