      <description>A little over a week ago I made a radical decision: I downloaded the newest version of Fedora 32 and installed it on my system. I left behind the suckless universe of dwm, the minimalism of Arch Linux, and the workflow based on terminal applications and automatic window layout to make way for a totally different system, bloated, and with a totally different workflow. What the hell was going through my head when I did that?</description>

      <description>For a long time I have tried to use applications for making notes, to-do lists, calendars and other &amp;#34;productivity&amp;#34; systems. However, I have always encountered the same problem: after a couple of days or weeks I stop using it.  About two years ago I discovered the GTD method of productivity. It seemed that I had just found the holy grail and that I was facing the definitive solution to my desire to introduce some productivity methodology into my life.</description>
