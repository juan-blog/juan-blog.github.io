      <description>For a long time I have tried to use applications for making notes, to-do lists, calendars and other &amp;#34;productivity&amp;#34; systems. However, I have always encountered the same problem: after a couple of days or weeks I stop using it.
 About two years ago I discovered the GTD method of productivity. It seemed that I had just found the holy grail and that I was facing the definitive solution to my desire to introduce some productivity methodology into my life.</description>

      <description>â€¦ the author  My name is Juan Castro, I have a big interest on technology, reading and videogames.
 Related to tech, I can say about four years ago I started to use GNU/Linux on my computers and since I never looked back; I started with Xubuntu 16.04, but now I use Arch Linux, btw. With a similar interest, about two years ago I started to use Tiling Window Managers instead of the clasics desktop environments.</description>
