My name is Juan Castro, I have a big interest on technology, reading and videogames.
</p>
<p>
Related to tech, I can say about four years ago I started to use GNU/Linux on my computers and since I never looked back; I started with Xubuntu 16.04, but now I use Arch Linux, btw. With a similar interest, about two years ago I started to use <em>Tiling Window Managers</em> instead of the clasics desktop environments. Afer my initiation on i3 and live quite a time on bspwm, now I use my own version of dwm.
</p>
<p>
Despite my liking for technology, my studies are for education, especifically, I have a degree on secondary education with a major in mathematics, in other words, math teacher. Since I&#39;m young I wanted to be a teacher, and I can say is a job that I enjoy a lot and has given me great experiences.
</p>
<p>
My social media? I never used Instagram nor Twitter actively, and I stopped ussing Facebook a year ago, and I don&#39;t regret! Today I spent most of my time <em>online</em> on others sources of entertainment, like YouTube (because there&#39;s no other alternative, though I hope LBRY becomes popular in the future), Reddit, and from time to time, mastodon and 4chan. And no, I&#39;m not disconnected from the world and I still find out the important things that happen in my city, my country and the world.

…this blog
</h2>
<p>
This blog arises as result of my interest on <em>blogging</em> as a way to express my opinions, as well as a way to write about topics that interest me and, in some cases, has low coberture on spanish, my mother language, I need to say that, despite is a common topic, this isn&#39;t a blog about technology, but a personal blog, where I just cover the topics that I like.
</p>
<p>
Technically, this blog is hosted on GitHub thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. This site is build with the static sites generator <a href="gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a program that I find relativelly easy to use (once you get the basics and you build a site). I use the <a href="https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil">Ezhil</a> theme; I like the minimalist look and feel. 
</p>
<p>
This isn&#39;t my first blog, before I had a little blog on a <a href="https://writefreely.org/">Write Freely</a> instance called <a href="qua.name">qua.name</a>. I decided to change because I wanted to write some posts (like this) both in spanish and english, sice I spend most of my time on forums and subrredits where the main langugae is english, and thanks to hugo I can add easily a button to change the language of the posts (located at the page footer).
